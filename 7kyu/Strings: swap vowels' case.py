"""
Special thanks to SteffenVogel_79 for the idea.

Challenge:

Given a string, return a copy of the string with the vowels' case swapped.

For this kata, assume that vowels are in the set "aeouiAEOUI".

Example: Given a string "C is alive!", your function should return "C Is AlIvE!"

Addendum: Your solution is only required to work for the ASCII character set.

Please make sure you only swap cases for the vowels.
